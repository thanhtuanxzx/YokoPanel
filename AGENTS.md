# Repository Instructions

## Workspace Intent

- `aaPanel/` is a local reference snapshot for product behavior, copy, layout, and implementation ideas.
- `src/` is the active yoko-panel codebase that we edit.

## Rules For Codex And Other Agents

- Do not modify files under `aaPanel/` unless the user explicitly asks to edit that directory.
- Treat `aaPanel/` as read-only reference material by default.
- When implementing or adjusting a feature in `src/`, check whether the same feature or UI pattern exists in `aaPanel/` first.
- Prefer matching aaPanel behavior and wording when the user asks for aaPanel-style UI or feature parity.
- Keep all new implementation work in the yoko-panel app unless the user clearly requests changes to the reference snapshot.

## Practical Workflow

- Use `aaPanel/` to inspect templates, scripts, and naming before changing `src/`.
- Copy behavior, not files: adapt the reference into the Rust yoko-panel architecture instead of patching aaPanel directly.
- If aaPanel and yoko-panel differ, preserve yoko-panel's runtime model while aligning UI and feature behavior as closely as practical.

## aaPanel Parity Checklist

- Locate the equivalent feature, template, or script inside `aaPanel/` before editing `src/`.
- Confirm whether the user wants visual similarity, behavior parity, or both.
- Reuse aaPanel wording, labels, and information hierarchy when practical.
- Implement the change in `src/`, not in `aaPanel/`.
- Keep a note of any intentional differences caused by Rust architecture, local platform limits, or missing backend data.

## Responsive UI Standards (Active Skill)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Automatic Documentation Rule**: Whenever a new significant UI pattern, technical "skill," or project-specific standard is established, the agent MUST automatically update this section in `AGENTS.md` to persist the knowledge for future sessions.

When modifying the dashboard layout, follow these synchronized responsive patterns to maintain consistency:

### 1. Unified Breakpoint (The 1100px Rule)
- All top-level dashboard sections (System Info, Sys Status, Overview) must trigger their responsive layouts together at **1100px**.
- This avoids intermediate "broken" states where some cards wrap while others stay horizontal.

### 2. Main Layout & Spacing
- **Sidebar-to-Content Gap**: Maintain a constant `24px` padding on the `.main` container for desktop views. This ensures the "white cards" never touch the "dark sidebar."
- **Mobile Container**: Adjust `.main` padding to `16px` or `20px` at lower breakpoints (e.g., 1100px) to balance screen real estate while preserving the gap.

### 3. System Info Card (Topbar)
- **Positioning**: Use `position: relative` on the container (`.topbar`).
- **Floating Actions**: On mobile/tablet, use `position: absolute; top: 18px; right: 18px;` for `.top-actions`.
- **Vertical Grouping**: Stack badges (`.top-plan`, `.top-meta`) above operation links (`.top-action-link`) in two distinct rows.
- **Overlap Prevention**: Apply `padding-right: 120px` to the main text container (`.topbar-main`) to ensure labels don't hide behind floating badges.

### 3. Metric Grids (Sys Status & Overview)
- **Persistent 2x2 Layout**: Grids must switch to `grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)` at 1100px and **maintain** this 2x2 structure even on the narrowest mobile screens.
- **Mobile Spacing**: Use `12px` to `16px` gaps/padding for mobile viewports to keep the layout compact but touch-friendly.
- **Meter Stability**: Ensure circular meters (`.meter`) scale appropriately (approx. 90px-110px) to fit side-by-side in the 2-column grid.

### 4. Website Page Responsive Pattern
- **Shared Breakpoint**: Website controls should join the same `1100px` breakpoint family used by the dashboard so toolbar/footer reflow happens before the table feels cramped.
- **Toolbar Reflow**: At tablet/mobile sizes, let `.website-toolbar-left` and `.website-toolbar-right` expand to full width; make search/select controls stretch instead of keeping fixed pixel widths.
- **Three-Control Toolbar Row**: On narrow Website layouts, keep category select, search field, and settings button on the same row using a 3-column grid instead of dropping search beneath the filter.
- **Narrowest Website Table**: On the smallest website breakpoint, keep a real table header instead of switching to card rows. Show only `Site name` and `Operate` so even an empty list still exposes the surviving columns.
- **Column Shedding Order**: On medium desktop widths, drop `WAF` first, then `Requests`, to protect `Site name` width. After that, when width gets tighter, drop `Quick action`, `SSL`, `Expiration`, then `Backup`, and finally `Status` only at the smallest table breakpoint. Preserve `Site name` as the main flexible column and keep `Operate` visible at the end.
- **HTTPS Marker**: In Website `Site name`, show HTTPS state as a compact lock icon instead of protocol text. Use green for HTTPS-enabled sites and red for HTTP/no HTTPS sites.
- **Web Server Runtime Button**: The Website toolbar web-server button must server-render the active `Apache`/`Nginx` label, version, and matching App Store runtime icon before JavaScript loads, so refreshes do not flash the generic `Web Server` state. Clicking the button should open the same two-pane Software Settings modal for the active runtime.
- **aaPanel Runtime Pill**: In Website, the active web-server button should match aaPanel's compact pill: Apache/Nginx icon on the left, `Name major.minor` text, and a right-side status glyph. Running uses a green pill with a play caret; stopped uses a light red pill with a pause glyph. Do not show patch versions such as `2.4.57` in this button, and do not fall back to `Web Server` when Apache or Nginx is installed but stopped.
- **Runtime Hover Popover**: Hovering or focusing the Website web-server pill should show a compact aaPanel-style quick action popover above it with `Stop` when running or `Start` when stopped, plus `Restart`, `Reload`, and `Alarm Setting`. Keep the popover open while the pointer is over it so the actions are clickable, and route the actions through the existing Software runtime controls.
- **Website Path Directory Picker**: In Add site, the Website Path folder icon should open an aaPanel-style directory selector modal. It should browse directories under the managed website root only, show breadcrumb/search/current selection, support creating a new directory, and write the confirmed folder path back to the Website Path input.
- **Modal Stacking**: Website create/delete dialogs should switch label-value rows to a single-column stack on narrow screens and make footer actions full width.

### 5. Software Page Responsive Pattern
- **Smallest Software Table**: On the smallest software breakpoint, keep the table header visible but reduce the table to only `App Name` and `Operate`.
- **Software Empty State**: The software empty row must use a dynamic `colspan` that matches the currently visible columns, so the message stays centered after responsive column shedding.
- **Software Name Priority**: Let `App Name` take the flexible width on mobile and keep `Operate` as a tight trailing column.
- **No Horizontal Scroll**: Do not rely on horizontal scrolling for the software table on tablet/mobile widths. Remove the large fixed table minimum and shed columns progressively instead.
- **Software Column Shedding Order**: Do not show an `Expire date` column in App Store. Hide `Instructions` first, then `Developer` and `Location`, then `Price`, and only at the smallest breakpoint hide `Status` so the table ends at `App Name + Operate`.
- **Software Display Toggle**: Keep the `Display` toggle column visible together with `Status` on desktop/tablet widths so operators can control the dashboard summary directly from the table; hide both only at the smallest breakpoint where the table collapses to `App Name + Operate`.
- **Software Secondary Actions**: Place `Update App List` inside the `Recently visited plugin` card, aligned to the right of that info strip instead of inside the filter rows.
- **Recently Strip Layout**: Keep the `Recently plugin` content and its right-side action on the same row when shrinking; let the text side compress first instead of dropping the action to a new line.
- **Software Settings Modal**: Keep `Setting` separate from the install/update version picker. It should open a dedicated two-pane modal with aaPanel-style left navigation and a service panel (`Stop`, `Restart`, `Reload`, alert toggle, daemon toggle); collapse the sidebar into wrapped chips on narrow screens instead of merging it back into the install modal.
- **Software Settings Frame**: Match aaPanel's compact manager sizing for the settings dialog (`800px` wide by `650px` tall on desktop) and keep the overlay centered inside the main content area. The settings overlay must start after the left sidebar (`204px` desktop, `74px` compact sidebar) so responsive states never cover the dark menu.

### 5.1. Database Page Responsive Pattern
- **Menu Position**: The sidebar Database entry replaces Traffic and must sit above `App Store`, matching aaPanel's information hierarchy.
- **aaPanel Database Skeleton**: Keep the Database page organized as tabs (`MySQL`, `SQLServer`, `MongoDB`, `Redis`, `PostgreSQL`), backup safety tip, toolbar actions, runtime/remote status strip, table, batch controls, and pagination.
- **aaPanel MySQL Toolbar**: In the MySQL tab, mirror aaPanel's top action row with `Add Database`, `Root password`, `phpMyAdmin`, `Remote DB`, `Advanced Setup`, `Sync all`, and `Get DB from server`, then place the runtime pill, feedback link, filter select, and search on the right. Unsupported actions may be visible but must stay disabled until backed by real endpoints.
- **aaPanel MySQL Table Shape**: Prefer the aaPanel MySQL column order `Database name`, `Username`, `Password`, `Quota`, `Backup`, `Location`, `Note`, `Operate`. Render `Backup` as inline status plus `Import`, and keep `Operate` as a flat text-action row with only truly supported actions enabled.
- **Toolbar Reflow**: Database toolbar controls should wrap at tablet widths; the search field must stretch full width before the table becomes cramped.
- **Table Column Shedding**: Preserve a real table header. Hide `Password` and `Quota` first, then `Backup` and `Note`, then `Username` and `Location` on the smallest breakpoint. Keep `Database name` and `Operate` visible at all widths.
- **Empty State Colspan**: Database empty rows must use a dynamic `colspan` based on currently visible columns so empty messages remain centered after column shedding.
- **Backend Honesty**: Database actions must only be enabled when backed by real endpoints. `Add Database` creates a MySQL database/user through the installed MySQL runtime; unsupported actions such as import, edit, backup, remote DB, and delete remain disabled until their endpoints exist.
- **Runtime Awareness**: The Database page should use App Store runtime state where available, especially MySQL/Redis/PostgreSQL install and running status, while still allowing local database file discovery to populate read-only rows.
- **Runtime Pill Parity**: The Database toolbar runtime button should mirror the Website runtime pill pattern: compact aaPanel-style runtime pill, green when running, light red when stopped, click-to-open settings, and hover/focus quick-action popover with `Start`/`Stop`, `Restart`, `Reload`, and `Alarm Setting`.
- **phpMyAdmin Access Modal**: The Database toolbar and runtime strip should expose a `phpMyAdmin` button. It opens an aaPanel-style modal with left navigation (`Service`, `PHP version`, `Security configuration`), a public-access toggle, and `Password-free access`/`Public access` buttons. Public access must open on the current YokoPanel origin, e.g. `http://localhost:8080/phpmyadmin/`, and the Rust `/phpmyadmin/*` proxy should forward to Apache's managed local alias so the browser stays on the panel port.

### 5.2. Files Page Responsive Pattern
- **aaPanel File Manager Shape**: Keep the Files page as an aaPanel-style file manager: tab strip, breadcrumb path bar, toolbar actions, search, real table header, footer summary, pagination controls, and right-side support links.
- **English Labels**: Use English UI copy for all File Manager labels, even when matching bt.cn/aaPanel layout.
- **Route And Menu**: The sidebar `Files` entry must route to `/files`, not a dashboard hash, and should stay above Terminal in the aaPanel-style information hierarchy.
- **Backend Boundaries**: File listing, read, write, and directory creation must stay inside the managed website root or approved panel data paths. Do not expose arbitrary system paths through the file manager.
- **Table Column Shedding**: Preserve a real table header. Hide `Enterprise anti-tamper` and `Remark` first, then `Permission/Owner` and `Size`, then `Modified time` on the smallest breakpoint. Keep `File name` and `Operate` visible.
- **Unsupported Actions**: Toolbar actions that do not have backend endpoints yet may be visible for visual parity but must remain disabled until real handlers exist.

### 6. Shared Close Button Pattern
- **Universal `X` Button**: Any dashboard/modal/dialog close button must use the shared circular close-button pattern, not a plain text `×`.
- **Base Look**: Render it as a gray circular button with a white `X` built from CSS lines, matching aaPanel-style floating closes.
- **Hover Motion**: On hover or keyboard focus, rotate the button `180deg` and switch the background to red.
- **Reuse First**: Prefer a shared utility class for new close buttons so future modals inherit the same size, transition, and icon treatment automatically.
- **Placement**: Use the floating top-right variant for overlay dialogs when practical; if a dialog keeps the close button inline in the header, keep the same visual treatment and hover behavior.

### 7. Runtime Lua Plugin Lifecycle
- When a runtime uses `data/plugins/*.lua`, the Rust install flow must call the Lua `on_install` hook after extraction and before `on_start`.
- The Lua bridge helper `panel.write_file(path, content)` must create the parent directory automatically so PID/config writes do not fail on fresh installs.
- Treat `on_install` as the place to prepare writable folders and generated config files such as `logs/`, `tmp/`, `php.ini`, or `my.ini`.
- PHP runtime setup must enable phpMyAdmin-required extensions in `php.ini`, including `extension_dir`, `mysqli`, `mbstring`, and `openssl`. The panel-side `/phpmyadmin/*` runner should also self-heal these settings for already-installed PHP runtimes before invoking `php-cgi`.
- phpMyAdmin config must use install-relative writable folders (`__DIR__ . '/tmp'`, `upload`, `save`) and the panel-side `/phpmyadmin/*` runner must recreate those folders and overwrite stale aaPanel-style `/www/server/...` `config.inc.php` values before invoking PHP.
- Apache-specific routing/config generation belongs in `data/plugins/apache.lua`; Rust should pass structured website/runtime data into Lua instead of hardcoding `httpd.conf`, `vhost`, or Apache path rewrites in `src/dashboard.rs`.
- Path roots must support env overrides. Use `YOKOPANEL_WEBSITE_ROOT` for site files and `YOKOPANEL_RUNTIME_ROOT` for installed runtimes; if the env value is relative, resolve it against the app base directory first, then current working directory.
- Lua runtime hooks must raise real failures with `error(...)` instead of returning `"Error: ..."` strings, so Rust can treat startup/setup failures as errors immediately.
- `panel.spawn(...)` is for detached long-running runtimes and must reject processes that exit immediately after launch; use Apache/PHP error logs only as extra detail, not as the primary success signal.
- Use `panel.spawn_detached(...)` for self-daemonizing Windows runtimes that should return immediately to Rust without the early-exit guard from `panel.spawn(...)`.
- Apache on Windows must not use `panel.spawn(...)` for `httpd.exe`, because the parent process exits immediately after handing off worker children and will be misdetected as a startup failure. Do not use `httpd.exe -k start` either, because that expects a Windows service such as `Apache2.4`. Do not use `panel.execute(...)` either, because it keeps the hook blocked while `httpd.exe` runs in the foreground. Launch Apache with `panel.spawn_detached(httpd.exe, {"-d", ..., "-f", ...})`, then let Rust verify the running process/port after the hook returns.
- Apache should only enable `Listen 443` and SSL modules when at least one managed site actually has SSL configured, to avoid startup failures from unrelated port `443` conflicts.
- The default managed website root is `www` under the app base directory unless `YOKOPANEL_WEBSITE_ROOT` overrides it. Create that directory automatically during runtime resolution so Apache `DocumentRoot` never points to a missing folder.
- Windows listener parsing belongs in Rust with unit tests in `src/dashboard.rs`; do not rely on one-off verification scripts under `scratch/` for runtime port detection behavior.
- Bundled SSL assets now live under `data/bin/ssl/`. Keep the local CA in `data/bin/ssl/ca/` and store generated site certificates directly in `data/bin/ssl/`, while reserving `data/bin/openssl/` for the OpenSSL executable and DLLs only.
- Local website SSL certificates should be signed directly by `data/bin/ssl/ca/rootCA.pem` and `rootCA-key.pem`; do not introduce an intermediate CA, because imported/mkcert-style roots may have path length constraints that make browser validation fail.
- Windows hosts elevation must use the Rust `update-hosts` helper binary (`src/bin/update-hosts.rs`) built by Cargo/build.rs into `data/bin/update-hosts.exe`; do not ship or call `data/bin/update-hosts.bat` in release builds.

### 8. Footer Edge Layout
- Dashboard footer/alert bars that need to sit at the bottom of the main content should use flex flow with `margin-top: auto`, not fixed positioning.
- The `.main` container should keep side/top padding but no bottom padding when a bottom edge footer is present, so the footer can touch the viewport bottom without creating extra scroll height.
- Edge footers should stretch across the `.main` content width and use negative inline margins based on the shared main padding variable; avoid hard-coded pixel offsets such as `-20px`/`-22px` because they leave 1px seams when padding or borders change.
- Remove left/right borders on full-width edge footers when they must visually touch the dark sidebar and right viewport edge.

### 9. Plugin Manifest Format
- Prefer one `data/plugin.json` entry per product family (for example one `php` entry), then declare installable builds inside `versions[]` instead of duplicating the whole plugin block per version.
- Each `versions[]` item may override `install_checks` when the runtime hook path differs by branch or major/minor version.
- Use `downloads[]` for package sources. The first URL is the primary download target and later URLs are ordered mirrors.
- Legacy `f_path` manifests remain readable in Rust, but new edits should use the grouped `versions[]` plus `downloads[]` format.

### 10. Frontend Template Packaging
- Dashboard frontend files live on disk under `data/templates/<theme>/` instead of `src/ui/` so builds copy the active UI alongside the executable rather than embedding it into Rust with `include_str!`.
- Login is shared across all templates and lives at `data/ui/shared/login.html`; `/login` must load this shared asset, not `data/templates/<theme>/login.html`, so changing the selected interface cannot strand users on a theme-specific login page.
- Keep `default` as the baseline theme folder and add new themes as siblings such as `data/templates/demo/`; runtime theme selection should resolve from `YOKOPANEL_TEMPLATE` and fall back to `default` if the requested theme is missing.
- `data/templates/` must contain theme directories only. Do not add `shared/` or other non-theme helper folders under `templates`; shared browser assets belong outside the theme tree.
- The topbar theme-switch control should list available UI themes from the real `data/templates/*` directories, persist the selected theme in panel-managed settings, and reload the page after a successful switch so all template assets come from the new theme immediately.
- All themes must use the shared topbar metadata IDs/classes: `#topbar-system` for `System: <os_name> (<kernel_version>)`, `#topbar-uptime` for formatted uptime, and `.top-version-label` for panel version. The backend `DashboardData.panel_version` is the source of truth, with `v11.1.0` as the default convention.
- All themes with a dashboard topbar must expose `#top-color-mode-button` using `.icon-top-brightness`; shared `initColorModeToggle()` manages `html[data-color-mode]` and persists the mode in `localStorage` under `yokopanel.colorMode`, while each theme stylesheet owns its dark palette overrides.
- aaPanel-style utility icons used by the topbar should live in each theme's `icons.css` as reusable classes, not inline SVG/text in `topbar.html` or `data/ui/shared/core.js`, so the language button, skin button, and picker rows stay visually consistent across templates.
- Keep each theme root flat: `layout.html`, `topbar.html`, `index.html`, `website.html`, `database.html`, `soft.html`, `styles.css`, `icons.css`, `favicon.svg`, and `app.js` should sit directly inside `data/templates/<theme>/` unless a later refactor introduces a documented asset layout.
- Shared browser logic for all themes belongs under `data/ui/shared/`; keep `core.js` for reusable state/helpers there, put page bootstrap shims in `data/ui/shared/pages/*.js`, and keep each theme's own `app.js` as a thin bootstrap/override layer.
- `data/ui/shared/*` is source-controlled as plain JS files, but Rust should serve the known shared assets from compile-time `include_str!` embeds so the binary keeps working even when that directory is not deployed separately. Keep the files on disk as the source of truth for editing, and only use runtime disk reads as a fallback for unembedded additions.
- Release builds must not copy or ship `data/ui/`; the shared UI is embedded in the executable, while `data/templates/*` remains on disk as the editable theme surface.
- Theme-specific dashboard asset URLs must include the active template as a cache key (for example `t={{ACTIVE_TEMPLATE}}`) so selecting a different interface reloads the matching CSS/JS immediately instead of reusing the previous theme from browser cache.
- When changing themed UI assets or HTML, update the files under `data/templates/...` directly; when changing login, update `data/ui/shared/login.html`. Preserve the existing `/assets/dashboard/*`, `/dashboard`, `/website`, and `/login` routes so backend handlers can swap themes without changing URLs.
- Shared language packs live under `data/lang/`, not inside individual theme folders, and are copied to `target/<profile>/data/lang` during Windows builds with the rest of runtime `data/`. Do not maintain a physical `data/lang/index.json`; `/assets/lang/index.json` is generated dynamically by scanning `data/lang/*.json`. Use `data/lang/<locale>.json` for flat `messages` keys plus `meta.locale`, `meta.label`, and `meta.nativeName`, and shared browser logic in `data/ui/shared/core.js` to load them through `/assets/lang/<locale>.json` so every theme consumes the same translations.
- Static text and translatable attributes in theme HTML should carry explicit `data-i18n` and `data-i18n-attr` keys whenever practical. `data-i18n-auto` is only a fallback for broad/runtime coverage; release template files should still expose concrete keys for visible labels so packaged HTML is auditable.
- Do not duplicate translated copy inside keyed theme markup. Prefer empty keyed elements such as `<h3 data-i18n="dashboard.load_status"></h3>` and empty translatable attributes such as `placeholder="" data-i18n-attr="placeholder:database.search"`; the shared language loader fills the visible text and attributes from `data/lang`.
